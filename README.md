# Production Data Analysis Dashboard

A modular data analysis pipeline that processes oil & gas production data, generates visualizations, and exports automated reports. Designed as a resume project to demonstrate practical skills in data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, reporting, and testing.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Cleans raw CSV files: handles missing values, invalid dates, and ensures numeric types.
  - Removes duplicates and formats timestamps.

- **Analysis**
  - Calculates total production by well and by region.
  - Supports custom aggregations.

- **Visualization**
  - Generates bar plots using `matplotlib` for regional and well-level production.
  - Saves plots to disk for use in reports.

- **Reporting**
  - Creates a PDF report using `reportlab`, embedding plots and summary statistics.

- **Testing**
  - Unit tests included for data cleaning and aggregation logic using `unittest`.
